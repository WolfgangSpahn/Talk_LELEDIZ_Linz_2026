## Research

Research on the impact of AI in education is still emerging, with mixed findings:

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%" .text-xs}

- MIT:"*Over four months,* <span class="blue">***LLM users consistently underperformed*** [less cognitive load, less recall] </span> at neural, linguistic, and behavioral levels. These results raise concerns about the long-term educational implications of LLM reliance and underscore the* ***need for deeper inquiry into AI's role in learning.***"
- Meta-Analysis: "*[The study] indicates a* <span class="blue">***large positive impact*** [large standardized mean difference] ***(g = 0.867) of ChatGPT***</span> on student learning performance. ... [with] significant differences [...] in the type of course, learning model, and duration. [For] higher-order thinking, it is crucial to provide corresponding learning scaffolds or educational frameworks*"

**It seems ChatGPT can <span class="blue">improve outputs while weakening internal cognitive construction</span> at the same time !?**

## Which Tutor Behavior?

With **AI**, we can pursue **very different learning approaches**.

<div class="compact-table">

|                  |         |                                                  |
| ---------------- | :-----: | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Assessing**    | ![](images/pr%C3%BCfend_icon.png){height="30px"}   |  Checks knowledge step by step, gives hints, responds evaluatively |
| **Solving**      | ![](images/l%C3%B6send_icon.png){height="30px"}    |  Provides the complete solution and solution path in a single answer |
| **Explaining**   | ![](images/erkl%C3%A4rend_icon.png){height="30px"} |  Delivers a structured solution in steps, checks understanding |
| **Socratic**     | ![](images/sokratisch_icon.png){height="30px"}     |  Guides the learning path through leading questions (suggestive) toward a predefined sequence |
| **<span class="blue">Epistemic</span>** | ![](images/epistemisch_icon.png){height="30px"} |  Gives feedback, hints, and structural support while leaving the solution path open |

</div>

AI should be able to support all of these teaching behaviors, but above all should pave the way toward **epistemic tutoring**, in order to sustainably develop real-world, higher-order thinking competencies.



<!-- --------------------------------------------------- slide ----------------------------------------------------- -->
## AIDu - Epistemic Concept

::::{.columns}

::: {.column width="50%" .small}
**Our AI tutoring concept** is based on the work of **Fred M. Newmann**, and by **John Bransford** and collaborators.

They argue that<span class="blue">**“authentic intellectual work”**</span> needs tasks that:

- require the **construction of knowledge** (not merely recall),
- require investigation, analysis, synthesis, and/or evaluation — **higher-order thinking**, and
- support **transfer** beyond school, preparing learners for future learning and real-world use.

which can only be assessed and realized through tasks that <span class="blue">**provide opportunities for struggle**</span> and require learners to find their way through:

- **Novel cases** (not seen in instruction)
- **Underspecified problems** (no obvious procedure)
- **Model conflict** (two explanations that both partially fit)
- **Representation mismatch** (graph vs text vs phenomenon)

<!-- This is highly desirable, but often falls short in everyday school practice. Here, AI can provide the necessary support capacity. -->

## AIDu - Microworlds

**Combine AI Dialog with Authentic Learning Contexts (Microworlds)**

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="35%" .small}
- **Student can freely explore the learning environment** and receive feedback from the AI tutor on demand
- **AI tutor provides feedback and scaffolding** aligned with learning goals, but does not prescribe a specific solution path
- Embedding the AI dialogue in an interactive learning environment reduces the risk of hallucinations and role

### Microworlds 

- are carefully designed, **self-contained learning environments**
- where students **explore, experiment, and construct knowledge**
- by interacting with a simplified version of a real or abstract system.

:::{.text-xs}

- For each dialogue turn, the system checks whether the AI tutor's response is aligned 
  - with the intended teaching behavior,
  - session goals and
  - domain-specific content
- Using a grounding of the dialogue in prolog-based speech act analysis, the system can **detect role violations, misinformation, or loss of tutor role**.

## Didactic Quality 1/2

To illustrate the importance of monitoring and quality control, we repeated a AI-Tutor, AI-Student dialogue 10 times with the same initial conditions and prompts.

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="40%"}
Despite of identical initial conditions, the dialogue diverges over time. We see deviations from the intended epistemic tutoring behavior, <span class="orange">wrong pre-suppositions</span> already in the first turn.

<span class="orange">"*An oral exam is not about helping the student to gain understanding, but about checking whether the student has already gained understanding.*"</span>

- The system architecture is designed to allow for <span class="blue">**different teaching behaviors**</span> (assessing, solving, explaining, Socratic, epistemic) to be implemented and switched between.
- Real-time monitoring of dialogue quality allows for <span class="blue">**detection (and correction) of non-compliances**</span> such as role drift, misinformation, or misalignment with learning goals.

## Scaffolding Requirements

The different teaching behaviors place very different scaffolding requirements on AI.
<br/>

<div class="compact-table">

|                  |         |                                                  |
| ---------------- | :-----: | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Assessing**    | ![](images/pr%C3%BCfend_icon.png){height="30px"}   | No scaffolding                                 |
| **Solving**      | ![](images/l%C3%B6send_icon.png){height="30px"}    | No scaffolding                                 |
| **Explaining**   | ![](images/erkl%C3%A4rend_icon.png){height="30px"} | Scaffolding for understanding                  |
| **Socratic**     | ![](images/sokratisch_icon.png){height="30px"}     | Scaffolding for problem solving                |
| **Epistemic**    | ![](images/epistemisch_icon.png){height="30px"}    | Scaffolding for finding one’s way              |

</div>

This is associated with very different requirements for AI in terms of **role definition, monitoring, and quality assurance**.

## AIDu - Risk Mitigation


**Risk Controls**

- Real-time pedagogical role monitoring
- Detection of epistemic violations and solution leakage
- Mathematical output validation
- Contextual grounding via simulation coupling
- Full interaction logging for auditability

**Human Oversight**

Teachers retain supervisory authority over system deployment, task configuration, and intervention in active sessions.

**Data Governance**

Interaction data are stored within controlled infrastructure.




<!-- --------------------------------------------------- slide ----------------------------------------------------- -->
## Pilot Study 1/2

::::{.columns}
::: {.column width="50%" .text-sm}

- **10 classes, Gymnasium Grades 1–2 (Computer Science)**
- AI-based tutor: **AIDu** guides students through a learning task "How to get my printer working?" in an interactive learning environment.
- Tutor is prompted to provide **epistemic support** (hints, feedback, and structural guidance) while leaving the solution path open.
- Polling of students and teachers after the session to evaluate the quality of interaction and learning experience.
- Pre, post, and follow-up tests to assess learning outcomes and retention.

### Statistics

::: {.text-3xs}
| Comparison                   | Pretest M (SD) | Posttest M (SD) | t(df)      | p      | d    |

| Overall (n = 84)             | 4.99 (5.72)    | 11.80 (5.93)    | −8.24 (83) | < .001 | 0.90 |
:::

**Knowledge increased significantly from pretest to posttest** with a large effect. While gender difference present at pretest was no longer significant at posttest.



### Interaction quality

Here we see a significant variability in the quality of interaction across dialogues => Symbolic supervision and monitoring is crucial in field systems.

- a **wide range of interaction quality**, 
- with **some dialogues showing consistent epistemic support**, 
- while others show **significant deviations** from the intended tutoring behavior, like acting as an ITC support.

<!-- --------------------------------------------------- slide -----------------------------------------------------

## First Observations

::::{.columns}
::: {.column width="50%" .text-sm}

Interaction patterns vary considerably:

Students use the AI tutor in very different ways, including:
- try to find path **on their own**, using the tutor only for **feedback and hints**
- accept **step-by-step guidance**, demanding a more structured solution path from the tutor, which led to conflicts
- attempts to obtain **complete solutions directly from the AI**, which could lead to a loss of the tutor's pedagogical role

**Key insights:**

- AI session can lead to significant learning gains
- AI systems must support learners **flexibly** and adapt to different learning strategies
- We could see tutor taking a pedagogical role, but the quality of interaction needs to be hardened against students' attempts to obtain complete solutions directly from the AI
- If learners insist on excessive support,  the tutor risks abandoning its **pedagogical role**
